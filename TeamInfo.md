## Project Summary

RunTrack: A Running Data Monitoring App
RunTrack is a web application designed to help users monitor and track their running data. The app allows users to input essential metrics like running time, speed, and pace, providing detailed insights into each session. Users can log their progress, analyze their performance, and set personalized fitness goals over time. Our project's key features include manual data entry, weather integration, and graphical analysis. Users can log in to manually enter data of their running details. Weater system provides users with valuable context to adjust their training plan according to different weather conditions. A well-designed graphical representation interface can help users to track their improvement through time, better helping them optimize their plans. This project also supports advanced features for serious athletes while remaining accessible to casual runners. The app will store data for both personal use and potential integration with public datasets.
